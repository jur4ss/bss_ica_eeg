'''
Plot values for channels in time domain.

Now lets assume that you are willing to use only the selected channels
(electrodes) then you have to pass ``picks`` argument. Again, if you leave
n_components unset the algorithm will generate as many components as many
channels you chose.

Tasks:
    03.01. Pick other electrodes and plot their timecourse in two ways.
    03.02. Uncomment the last line to see the unfiltered signal.

# Input file location.
input_filepath = os.path.join(os.environ['HOME'],
              'eeg_data/SSVEP_Bakardjian_MAT/SUBJ1/SSVEP_14Hz_Trial1_SUBJ1.MAT')

# Select some electrodes.
picks = get_biosemi_indices(['A10', 'A15', 'A21', 'A23', 'A28', 'B7', 'C17'])


# Create an object to govern the analysis.
bss_ica = ICAManager(input_filepath, picks=picks)


'''
In the bieg class there are two ways to plot the signal timecourse.

First one is an internal MNE's plot() method that can be called upon a raw
dataset object.

The second one was written in pure, simple matplotlib and plots each electrode
in separate figure.
'''

# First method.
bss_ica.plot_timecourse()

# Press any key. Without this pause, the canvas is overwritten automatically.
input('\n ***PAUSED*** Press return key to proceed ...\n')

# Second method.
bss_ica.plot_timecourse_mpl()

# To plot the timecourse without bandpass filter.
#  bss_ica.plot_timecourse_mpl(filter=None)
